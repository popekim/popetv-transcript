안녕하세요. 이것은 Pope입니다.
오늘 저는 정말 의미 없는 것에 대해 말할 것입니다.
이것은 누군가에게 도움이 되지 않습니다.
음, 제가 생각해보면,
half of pope TV는 항상 좋은 일을 하는 것입니다.
하지만 저는 영광입니다.
오, 제가 지난 주에 무엇을 했을까요?
음, 나는 조금씩 캐나다에 돌아왔습니다.
음, 그래서 이제 몇 명이 저를 왜 이렇게 하는지 물어보는 것입니다.
여러분은 이미 알고 있는 것입니다.
하지만 그를 숨기기에는 좋지 않습니다.
그래서 저는 그것에 대해 이야기할 것입니다.
저는 공격하지 않았습니다.
오, 제가 학생이 되었습니다.
몇 년 전,
소갱 대학교의 게임 교육센터에서 학생이 되었습니다.
거기서,
한 년에 한 번씩, 두 년에 한 번씩,
한국에 갔기 시작했습니다.
그러나 여기에서,
저는 학생이 되었습니다.
그래서, 여러분이 저를 알고 있는 것에 대해서,
캐나다에 있는 B.C.I.T라는 학교가 있습니다.
그 학교는 실질적으로 유명합니다.
그래서,
그 학교는 전문학과,
하지만 가장 유명한 학교는,
2 중 4 년 동안 졸업할 수 있습니다.
그 학교는 중학교 학습입니다.
그리고 두 년 더 지내면,
수업을 받습니다.
그리고 그 학교는 대학 생활을 할 수 있습니다.
그 학교는,
중학교 학습을 받는 학교입니다.
그 학교는,

그 학교에서 졸업할 때,
친구들이 학교에 가고 있는데,
그래서,
그 학교에 한 번씩,
한국에서 한 년이나 두 년 동안 졸업할 수 있습니다.
하지만,
그 학교에 졸업한 사람은,
외국인 학생들,
그 학교의 수업이지만,
그 학교의 중학교는,
4 년 동안 졸업할 수 있습니다.
하지만,
우선,
그 학교에 졸업을 하실 수 있습니다.
그리고,
그 학교에서 적극적인 훈련을 받았습니다.
그래서,
이것은 유명한 학교입니다. 그래서 실제 이민자들이 여기에 오는 경우는,
다시 pre-registration을 하기가 어렵습니다. 그래서 많은 사람들이 여기에 2년 동안 여기에 왔습니다.
사실, BCIT를 모르는 사람도 거의 없죠.
사실, 캐나다에 가면 BCIT를 알 수 있습니다.
그래서 이것은 유명한 학교입니다.
그리고 제 의견은, 여기에 학교에 갔다면,
다른 학교를 안 가게 될 가능성이 높습니다.
어렸을 때, 여기에 왔을 때까지.
이유는, 저는 학교에 좋은 관점을 가지고 있는 사람은 아닙니다.
하지만, 학교는 지금의 목적을 가지고 있습니다.
다른 비디오나,
혹은 나중에 말할 것입니다.
하지만 그런 의미에서, 많은 학교는 이미 좋은 방식으로 하고 있습니다.
이것은 죽음의 교육입니다.
그런 상황에서, 학교들이 많이 바뀌어야 합니다.
그리고 저는 BCIT의 이유는,
그 학교들이 살아남을 수 있는 이유는,
여러분은 이미 그 어렴한 방식으로 덜 배우고 있습니다.
물론, 여러분은 안 배우는 것 같지는 않지만,
저는 그 학교에서 학생이 되었습니다.
물론, 저는 그 학교에 졸업했습니다.

제가 생활 주에서 그것을 learned of I wish a decent degree in computer science.

그리고 요즘은 학교 보다 회사에서 일하는 이유는,
내가 성장할 때마다, 내가 가장 좋은 사람들과 함께 일해야 한다고 생각해.
아니면 가까운 사람들.
하지만 학교에 있다면,
보통 가장 멀어진 사람들로부터 배우는 것을 알게 됩니다.
그래서 제가 그것에 대해 더 깊이 설명하고 싶지 않습니다.
하지만 그런 경우가 있습니다.
그리고 어쨌든,
실제 일은 학교와는 많이 다릅니다.
과거에 대해서는 모릅니다.
하지만 제 의견으로는,
학교는 20년이나 30년 동안 학생들을 느끼게 된 것입니다.
오히려,
저는 자신과 함께 열심히 일하는 동안,
거기에서 foundation을 만들고,
더 많이 공부하고 싶을 때, 더 많이 공부하고 싶습니다.
하지만,
학생들을 많이 공부하고 싶을 때,
사실,
많은 경우는,
30년 전과 20년 전의 무엇을 배웠는지,
이제는 직장에서 사용할 수 없습니다.
오히려,
직장에서 일을 했을 때,
열심히 일을 했을 때,
훨씬 더 앞으로 나아가고 있습니다.
저는 그것에 대해 많이 생각했습니다.
그리고 그 상황에서,
제가 지금 학생이 된 것에 대해서,
제가 궁금해지는 것은,
무엇을 해야 할까요?
학교에 있다면,
왜 이제 3개의 공식 학교가 있습니다?
그리고,
2년이 남았다고 생각하시면,
4개가 남았습니다.
하지만,
저는 계속 일을 하고,
그렇게 일을 했었습니다.
그래서,
처음으로,
저는,
2년 전까지,

직장에서 일을 했을 때,
다른 이유는,
제가 의학을 받았기 때문입니다.
그리고,
의학을 받은 이유는,
사실,
BCIT에 들어갔기 때문입니다.
왜,
제가 학생이 된 때,
제가,
학생이 된 때,

그래서 저는 학생이 되었습니다.

제가 지금 정말 사랑하는 것들이 있습니다.
저는 지금 학생이 되는 것에 대해 많이 생각합니다.
지금 저는 제가 한 일을 했을 때,

저는 열심히 노력했고, 저에게 많은 도움이 되었다고 생각합니다.
하지만 그런 상황에서, 시간이 지나면,
학교는 맞도록 움직일 것입니다.
하지만 그의 방향은 자신을 보호하기 위해 다르게 움직이는 것 같습니다.
예전에,
I was a part-time lecturer at a cover art college that was a little worse than BCI, and I worked there for three years as a professor.
I was a part-time lecturer, but even then, I felt that way.
This school is too obsessed with making money.
It's a similar feeling.
But now BCIT is not like that.
It's a public school.
So aren't we still doing too little of what we need to produce great engineers?
Rather than that, I thought, oh, okay, if you come to our school, everything will be fine, and I wanted to become a professor who doesn't teach kids the reality and tells them the reality.
So, I became a professor at BCIT, and although it's full-time, I still think of it as a side job.
The reason is that I still have work to do at Silicon Valley, and even if something comes up and I can't do that work, I have another job.
I have another consulting company that I work for.
Then, I think that company will definitely be my first priority and teaching will be my second priority.
If you think about it, the reason professors have to teach for 20 hours a week is to use the remaining time for research.
But I've always felt this way, but I've never received any proper education in computer engineering.
Before I started, I was a professor at a company called Silicon Valley.


After I started working, those two years were all.
The rest was all self-study, and while working, I kept finding new things and new things, and I contributed to fields that I knew nothing about.
And I always tried to be the best in that field, and although I wasn't the best, I thought I was very good at it.
What I gained from that process is that I've already developed and grown more than what professors or what you might call great professors or professors who are above average do, juice.
그래서 요즘은 IT 기업이나 다른 테크니컬 수업의 주요 힘이 아카데미가 아니라 기업이 아닙니다.
그래서 새로운 일을 하는 것에 의해서 학생들에게 더 좋은 일을 배울 수 있습니다.
그리고 저는 사실은 학생들의 발전을 생각합니다.
그런 점에서 제 목표는 분명히 설치되어 있습니다.
음...
여기 두 가지를 기억해 두세요.
제가 면안에 있었을 때, 이하 대학생들의 학생들이 저에게 방문했습니다.
저는 그들을 알지 않았지만, 그들을 들었다고 말했습니다.
"먹자, 우리 같이 밥을 먹자." 라고 했죠.
그래서 저는 "오케이"라고 말했습니다.
그리고 우리는 밥을 먹었고, 그들은 왜 물어봤을까요?
그래서 저는 교수님으로서 일을 하는 것에 결심했습니다.
그래서 이것은 제 2번째 직업입니다.
교수님들이 첫 번째 직업이라고 생각합니다.
그래서 저는 "그런데 교수님은 어떻게 일을 하는 걸까요?" 라고 생각했습니다.
그래서 저는 "
" .
...

그러한 상황에 저의 목적은 저에 대한 공기를 Console.
그래서 저는 더 좋은 교수님도 없 sneez

그래서 저는 아직 tracing ast를 하고 있습니다.
하지만 문제의mayın был honestly 걱정입니다.

A while ago, I suddenly went down to Silicon Valley and suddenly became a professor, and when I was going to Canada for a short while, something really interesting happened.
Actually, I had thought that I would become a professor someday, so when I was about to become a professor, I talked to someone I knew at BCIT.
He said, do you guys still hire a lot of professors these days?
So I got a master's degree from there.
They do hire master's degree applicants.
But they said that these days, most universities don't hire applicants without a doctorate.
So after hearing that, I thought, the school is going backwards again.
On the contrary, a doctorate is good, but in my opinion, even if you don't have anything to do, if you're an excellent person, I think it's normal to bring them in.
Well, school is school, and the rules are the rules, but since it says on paper that anyone with a master's degree or higher can apply, I told them to just let me know when the opportunity arises and that I would apply then.
So I was writing down a lot of possibilities.
Oh yeah, I was in that situation and then I went down to Silicon Valley.
After about a month, I suddenly got a call from BC.
They said, we have this off-year thing, and I think you'd be a good doctor.
So why don't you apply?
I was like, um, um.
They just contacted me first, so I felt bad about letting it go.
When I was thinking about not getting a PhD and putting in a master's degree, it would be annoying, so I just submitted my resume.
Then they contacted me right away to see my area, so I got on a plane and went to see my area.
At that time, I think it was three days after I had taken the interview, and I was meeting a friend and having lunch when I got a call saying,
Hi!
So I had the interview, and I think I got a call back 30 minutes later.
So when I asked them what was going on, they said it wasn't a part-time lecturer, but a full-time lecturer, and I thought about it for a long time.
I went down to Silicon Valley and worked with Wausau, which I was currently working at, and I thought that I would do this someday, but I think that Silicon Valley will develop and grow.
I think that if I grow, I might not be able to be a doctor.
I don't want to be a professor anymore, but I want to do it for at least one semester.
Once the opportunity came, what is one time?
After teaching at school once, even if I take a semester off, or maybe I have to resign, I just thought that I couldn't do it at another time.
When I go back later, I'm less likely to be bothered by this kind of thing.
Since he was already teaching and there was a professor evaluation, and I didn't think I would be evaluated as a professor,
I thought it would be easy to change my mind in that situation, so I wanted to give it a try.
And in a way, I think my parents would be really happy that their son is now a professor.
That is, when I was a student in Korea and said that I wanted to be a professor at BCI someday, my father also said, then I can be a professor here too.
So I wanted to be a professor at BCI someday.
So I've been doing it here and there.
I've already taught for three years in Canada, so I'm a part-time lecturer.
And in my opinion, there aren't many people with as much proper experience as I am.
In that situation, the school is offering me a part-time job.
So the name is different. Is the name an assistant professor?
No, I'm a professor, but the part-time job is the same.
So to be honest, I'm not a professor. I'm a part-time job.
So to be honest, when I listened, I felt a little bit, a little bit, a little bit hurt, and to put it simply, I didn't understand.
No, I already had three years of work experience, and I studied abroad, and I don't have a doctorate, but my work experience is great, and I'm well known here and there, and now they're telling me to start from the very bottom.
So I tried this and that, and of course that's how it goes, and now they're telling me that if I work hard, I'll do well.
But then I'll be able to move up quickly.
I didn't really feel like they were doing anything based on merit, and it was just like that.
It wasn't the kind of value evaluation that I'd believed in and lived by.
I just think that's how the value evaluation of people and jobs should be done, but that wasn't it.
So when I told my father that I didn't think he was going to be able to do it, I said, no, I'm not going to do it.
I'm not going to do it.
He was a little disappointed.
But then after coming here and entering the Christian Council after a few months, there's something that Korean people think about.
It's really hard for Korean kids to go abroad and become professors.
So I think my father is also really proud of me because of that.
He secretly liked the fact that I became a professor rather than just rolling around in the industry.
So I thought, oh, it's good to make my parents proud.
I made a video like that once before.
It was about how to be filial to your parents.
So since I'm not in Korea, my parents are in Korea now, but I guess I'm not being filial to them properly.
In that situation, I thought, oh, that's why this kind of thing happened again.
So when I considered it for various reasons, I felt like I absolutely had to do it, so I did it.
And to be honest, the company didn't want me to work hard.
They asked me to do it.
So while I was at Sarah Kahn Lee all day, I worked 14 hours a day, 13 hours a day.
I left at 9 and went home at night.
The reason was that I had to do this, so I should have finished the work more thoroughly.
There were no weekends.
It's not that I go to work when other people have the weekend off, but when the other people in the office were resting and such, I don't have any of that.
I just work hard and work the most in terms of time.
I'm very focused.
I've been working very hard.
So I've been working very hard.
I've been working very hard to finish the work that I need to finish, that is, the work that I need to finish to get to the next big level.
Ah, I think I came up on December 28th, and I finished it by the 26th or 27th, and now I'm looking at the tarot and thinking, what should I do?
And I came up the next day.
So that's how it happened, and I'm taking a break from that.
As I said earlier, this is BCIT's my second job, and because it's full-time, I'm working remotely right now.
And whenever I get the chance, I go to Silicon Valley and my house, and my house isn't really my house, it's a two-hour and five-minute flight away.
So whenever I get the chance, I have to go down and work again, and it's important to see people in person, so it's gotten incredibly busy again.
So it's been a week since I've been out of school, and I'm halfway through the lectures, and I teach two programs.
I graduated from the computer program department, and now I go to a computer program department.
And now I go to another school and teach programming to designers in the same department.
I have to do that too, so I ended up doing two.
So, if you look at it, the time I spend working in Silicon Valley will decrease a little, but it doesn't seem to decrease at all.
So, I think I'll live like that for the next semester or so.
It's a matter of measurement. Life is.
So that's how it is, and I'm not saying I'm going to do these two things roughly.
That's absolutely not true.
Anyway, I think I've almost always had two jobs throughout my life.
I always had time, and then there was the two-year program I mentioned earlier.
You have to add two more years to that two years to get a bachelor's degree, but you can do it part-time.
If you take it in seven years, you get a bachelor's degree.
If you take all the courses, I can get it in two years.
While others take it full-time in two years, I took a part-time job while working full-time at a company and took a full-time course load.
Then, while I was getting it, I worked as an instructor for three years.
So I had three jobs.
That's how I did it.
And now, when I got my master's degree, I still took a year and a half or two years while working at a company and doing other things.
So it doesn't seem difficult, but I just won't have much time to play.
It's good not to play. That's what I'm doing.
That's why I brought it up a lot. But since I'm getting closer, I just brought it up.
So I became a professor.
Well, rather than saying, oh, I'm so proud of myself because I became a professor, I said, oh, I became a professor.
I'm great.
I'm great.
I always thought that I had to be careful.
I was careful not to criticize my academic background because I was a bit biased.
And another thing is that this might be something I wanted to do, but I'll make this the last one.
Well, there are a few areas where I have strong opinions.
So when I express those opinions, there are people who say, oh, you don't know because you have this opinion.
And there were a few typical understandings that were the same when I was in academia.
So, since you don't have a lot of engineering experience and you don't have any formal education, you just do whatever you want, so they say, you're better than academia.
So, there are people who study hard in academia, people who are tech trick academia, and people who are tech tree academia.
I think that on average, people who are tech tree academia are much better, whether it's skill or whatever.
But now that I'm on that side, if I start criticizing this side, I'll look like a politician.
So I thought that in order to accurately reflect my opinion, I had to follow the values that this side respects anyway.
Otherwise, my words won't be accepted.
Right now, in my head, in a few years, we'll eventually have to turn academia upside down.
And I don't know exactly how to turn it upside down, but I think it's going to happen.
If I have time, I'd like to try that, honestly.
I'd like to change academia a bit, but it's still a long way off.
And in order for that to happen, for someone to believe in me and think,
"Oh, this is right, and follow me," I have to have the values that I'm talking about there.
The values that they think are good.
So in that sense, I'm climbing the academic tree.
I'm the type of person who wants to fix anything that's broken, so that's also strong.
And so when I say that I'm going to do academics in the future and there's this problem,
there are people who say things like,
Oh, you don't know.
You went to school and didn't know.
I wish I could write down those words one by one.
Rather, I wish there was a constructive change in the field where people know what I'm trying to say,
know what pragmatic scholarship is,
and use it to actually develop what is called technological development.
The next generation technology that we don't know yet.
But these days, there are more and more people who just want to get their food stamped on them.
Oh, I'm not going to be able to get my food stamped on them.


I'm not saying that all of them are like that.
But there are a lot of people like that.
People like that keep blurting out the issue with strange things.
And while they're trying to protect their own interests, they can't protect their bigger interests.
I hope that there will be fewer cases like that in all fields.
So from my small greed to the proper social situation that I want now,
I've done all kinds of things.
And in a word, I just became a professor.
It's not a visual thing.
It's a visual verb.
But I became a religious verb.
And I think I've climbed all the trees I wanted to climb in school.
First of all, honestly, I don't really want to get a doctorate.
I want to do other things rather than spending time on that.
Yes, it was a table.
